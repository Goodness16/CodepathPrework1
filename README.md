## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   
   I used browsers and chrome searches for how to add images, and how to add audio files. Apart from that,
   the only other material I used is the guideline for the project.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
  The instructions were actually pretty straight forward, and the explanations were also comprehensive so I did not really struggle with any part of this project,
  however, one part of the project that perplexed me was the audio part. I just copied the code initially and then after I finished the projectI went back to 
  understand how it works reading the prompt and checking things I do not understand with Google, I still do not get the full functionality but I understand a little
  bit more than I did. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   One of the questions I have is now that I have made my website, how do I upload it. How can I make it public like glitch.com, chess.com and other popular public 
   websites. I also really want to understand the backend of websites, the webservers, HTTP and other elements of websites. How are those parts developed and link with 
   javascript, css, html and the languages we used to develop these websites. Also, I wonder if it was this simple for developers of websites like glitch.com. 
   Lastly, my favorite programming language is Python, can Python be used for web development? If not, why can it not be used and is it js or nothing. If it can be used
   why is it not often used, are there some disadvantages compared to js?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   I covered some ground in the hours I did. In fact, maybe you may notice it before reading this readme but the seemingly random pictures I used should remind the previous generation of the "Do-Re-Mi" song from
   Sound of Music, and the pattern is also the whole song. I would have loved to add a timer feature, however. And I would have also loved to change the pictures to cute pictures of dogs and different barks for 
   different dog breeds. I could have done the random pattern but I really wanted to do a cringe representation of Sound of Music, so if I had some more time I would have done 2 modes, the Sound of Music mode and
   the random mode.
